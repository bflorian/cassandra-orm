Provides GORM-like dynamic methods for persisting Groovy objects into Cassandra (but does not implement the GORM API).
It also adds a number of dynamic methods and arguments specific to typical Cassandra usage, like the ability to specify consistency level and manipulate counters.
Must me used in concert with the cassandra-astyanax plugin.
